The French Revolution, a period of radical social and political upheaval in late eighteenth-century France, had a major impact on France and indeed all of Europe. The absolute monarchy that had ruled France for centuries collapsed in three years. French society underwent an epic transformation as feudal, aristocratic, and religious privileges evaporated under the onslaught of the Enlightenment ideals such as popular sovereignty, inalienable rights, and the separation of powers.  The Revolution began with the convocation of the Estates-General in May 1789 and culminated in November 1799 with the formation of the French Consulate. Many of its ideas are considered fundamental principles of Western liberal democracy. The causes of the French Revolution are complex and still debated among historians.  However, several factors were clearly important.  The French monarchy faced a major economic crisis. Decades of expensive wars, including involvement in the American Revolution, had drained the French treasury. The French tax system was inefficient and unfair, placing an undue burden on the peasantry and the urban poor.  Furthermore, France suffered a series of poor harvests in the 1780s that sent food prices soaring. This led to widespread food shortages, bread riots and popular unrest.  The Enlightenment ideals that emphasized reason and individual liberty also greatly influenced the revolution.
