This section introduces the concept of uniformly continuous functions.  A function $f: A \to \mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous on $A$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x, y \in A$, $|x - y| < \delta$ implies $|f(x) - f(y)| < \epsilon$.  This definition differs subtly but importantly from the definition of continuity at a point.  While continuity at a point $c$ requires finding a $\delta$ that depends on both $\epsilon$ and $c$, uniform continuity requires a single $\delta$ that works for all points $x$ and $y$ in the set $A$, given a specific $\epsilon$. This means the size of the interval around $x$ needed to control the function's variation depends only on the desired tolerance $\epsilon$ and not on the specific location of $x$ within the set $A$.

An example is provided to illustrate this concept. The function $f(x) = 2x$ is uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$. Given any $\epsilon > 0$, choosing $\delta = \epsilon / 2$ satisfies the condition for uniform continuity.  If $|x - y| < \delta = \epsilon / 2$, then $|f(x) - f(y)| = |2x - 2y| = 2|x - y| < 2(\epsilon / 2) = \epsilon$.  This demonstrates how a single $\delta$ value works for all $x$ and $y$ in $\mathbb{R}$.

Conversely, the function $g(x) = x^2$ is not uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$. While continuous at every point, it becomes increasingly steep as $|x|$ grows.  This increasing steepness means that for a fixed $\epsilon$, smaller and smaller values of $\delta$ are required as $|x|$ increases to ensure $|g(x) - g(y)| < \epsilon$ whenever $|x - y| < \delta$. No single $\delta$ can satisfy the condition for all $x$ and $y$ in $\mathbb{R}$ for a given $\epsilon$.

A key theorem related to uniform continuity states: if $f: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous on the closed and bounded interval $[a, b]$, then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[a, b]$.  This theorem asserts that continuity on a closed and bounded interval guarantees uniform continuity.  This provides a practical way to establish uniform continuity for functions on such intervals, as we only need to prove continuity.
