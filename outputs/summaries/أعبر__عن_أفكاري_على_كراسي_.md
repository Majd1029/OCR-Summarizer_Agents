This section introduces the concept of the directional derivative and its relationship to the gradient.  The directional derivative of a scalar function $f(x, y)$ at a point $(x_0, y_0)$ in the direction of a unit vector $\mathbf{u} = \langle a, b \rangle$ is defined as the limit  $D_{\mathbf{u}}f(x_0, y_0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + ah, y_0 + bh) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h}$.  This represents the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ as we move from $(x_0, y_0)$ in the direction of $\mathbf{u}$.  A key theorem states that if $f$ is a differentiable function of $x$ and $y$, then $f$ has a directional derivative in the direction of any unit vector $\mathbf{u} = \langle a, b \rangle$, and this derivative is given by $D_{\mathbf{u}}f(x, y) = f_x(x, y)a + f_y(x, y)b$. This theorem provides a practical method for calculating directional derivatives using the partial derivatives of the function.

The gradient of a function $f(x, y)$ is defined as the vector $\nabla f(x, y) = \langle f_x(x, y), f_y(x, y) \rangle$.  It is a vector whose components are the partial derivatives of $f$. The theorem connecting the gradient and the directional derivative states that if $f$ is a differentiable function of $x$ and $y$, then $D_{\mathbf{u}}f(x, y) = \nabla f(x, y) \cdot \mathbf{u}$.  This means the directional derivative of $f$ in the direction of $\mathbf{u}$ is the dot product of the gradient of $f$ and the unit vector $\mathbf{u}$.  This formulation reveals that the gradient vector points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of $f$, and the magnitude of the gradient vector, $||\nabla f||$, is the maximum value of the directional derivative.  Conversely, the negative of the gradient vector points in the direction of the greatest rate of decrease of $f$.  Furthermore, if the gradient is the zero vector, then the directional derivative is zero in all directions.
