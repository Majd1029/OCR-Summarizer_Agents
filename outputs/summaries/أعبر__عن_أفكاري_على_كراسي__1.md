This section focuses on the concept of a function and its properties.  A function $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in $A$ exactly one element $y$ in $B$.  This is denoted as $f: A \to B$. The set $A$ is called the domain of $f$, and the set $B$ is called the codomain of $f$.  For an element $x$ in $A$, the element $y$ in $B$ assigned to $x$ by $f$ is denoted $f(x)$ and is called the value of $f$ at $x$, or the image of $x$ under $f$. The range of $f$ is the set of all images of elements of $A$.  Importantly, a function must assign a value to every element in its domain, and that value must be unique.  Two functions are equal if they have the same domain, the same codomain, and assign the same value to each element in their domain.

Several important types of functions are defined.  A function $f: A \to B$ is injective (or one-to-one) if for all $x_1, x_2 \in A$, if $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $x_1 = x_2$.  In other words, no two different elements in the domain can map to the same element in the codomain.  A function $f: A \to B$ is surjective (or onto) if for every $y \in B$, there exists an $x \in A$ such that $f(x) = y$. This means that every element in the codomain is the image of at least one element in the domain.  A function that is both injective and surjective is called bijective (or a one-to-one correspondence).  Bijective functions are crucial because they have inverses.

The inverse of a function $f: A \to B$ is a function $f^{-1}: B \to A$ such that for all $x \in A$ and $y \in B$, $f^{-1}(y) = x$ if and only if $f(x) = y$.  A function has an inverse if and only if it is bijective.  The composition of functions $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to C$ is a function $g \circ f: A \to C$ defined by $(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$ for all $x \in A$.  In other words, the composition applies $f$ to $x$ and then applies $g$ to the result.  The identity function on a set $A$, denoted $id_A: A \to A$, is defined by $id_A(x) = x$ for all $x \in A$. This function simply maps each element to itself.
